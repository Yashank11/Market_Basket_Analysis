This Market Basket Analysis (MBA) project, authored by Chua Ren You, employs the Apriori algorithm to uncover purchasing patterns within a groceries dataset. The project begins with data importation, cleaning, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset's structure and key characteristics. By examining transaction records from 2014 to 2015, the author identifies the most frequently purchased items and the purchasing behaviors of unique members. Using the Apriori algorithm, the analysis reveals strong association rules among items such as sausage, whole milk, and yogurt, indicating a high likelihood of these items being bought together. The project suggests placing these items near each other or offering promotional bundles to enhance sales. Through thorough data preprocessing, transactional encoding, and insightful visualizations, the project not only demonstrates the practical application of the Apriori algorithm but also provides actionable insights for retail strategies. The author's reflection highlights the educational value of the experience, inviting feedback for further improvement.
